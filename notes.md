# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Websites

+ There are two types of websites - static and dynamic.

+ Static websites have fixed content that does not change.

+ Content in a dynamic website can change, either by users or automatically for different users

+ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies of the World Wide Web(WWW).

+ HTML elements are accessed using angular brackets, or commonly known as tags. These tags are used to create the structure for a web page.

+ CSS is used to enhance the appearance of a web page.

+ JavaScript is a scripting language that plays a vital role in developing dynamic websites. It is used for user interaction, content management, manipulating databases, and many more.
